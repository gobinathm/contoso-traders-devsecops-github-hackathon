# 🚀 DevSecOps Mastery with GitHub

## Contoso Traders – Hackathon Implementation Repository

This repository contains my implementation of the **Contoso Traders** e-commerce application as part of the **DevSecOps Mastery with GitHub Hackathon – Day 1 (Accelerate Development with GitHub Copilot)**.

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate how modern DevSecOps practices can be successfully integrated into a cloud-native application using GitHub and Azure technologies.

---

# 🏢 Application Overview

**Contoso Traders** is a cloud-native e-commerce platform built with:

* ⚛️ React Front-End
* 🔷 .NET Back-End APIs
* 🧩 Microservices Architecture
* 🐳 Containerized Services
* ☁️ Azure Cloud Integration

This implementation focuses not just on building features, but on embedding **security, automation, monitoring, and AI-assisted development** throughout the software lifecycle.

---

# 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository demonstrates:

* End-to-end CI/CD implementation using GitHub Actions
* Secure development practices with GitHub Advanced Security
* Dependency and secret management automation
* AI-assisted feature development using GitHub Copilot
* Monitoring and observability integration
* Resilience-focused cloud-native architecture

The goal is to showcase how DevSecOps principles can be applied to a real-world application environment.
