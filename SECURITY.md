## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Please report security vulnerabilities by opening a private issue labeled
"security" or by emailing security@example.com. After a report is received
we will acknowledge within 3 business days and provide periodic updates as
we investigate. If a vulnerability is confirmed, we will coordinate a
fix and a responsible disclosure timeline with the reporter.

If you are reporting a critical vulnerability, please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (minimal repro if possible)
- The affected version(s)
- Any suggested mitigation or workarounds

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will not pursue legal action for
good-faith vulnerability reports.
